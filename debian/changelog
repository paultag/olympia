olympia (1.0.2) olympia-unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a Depends on olympia-libpam-pkcs11 from olympia-serving-suggestions,
    which means it'll be pulled in by default on standard desktop installs.
  * Add a new metapackage for server installs that doesn't depend on the
    custom PAM work or Desktop stuff.
  * Add a new archive .deb that contains my archive's OpenPGP keyring,
    and sources.list entry. This isn't depended on by anything, and is
    mostly helpful to get a new system set up quicker.

olympia (1.0.1) olympia-unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a new module, olympia-libpam-pkcs11, which depends on libpam-pkcs11,
    and installs some configs that make sense for me (a CA, my CN mappings),
    and the pam-auth template. Run `pklogin_finder` to make sure this all
    works before swapping PAM modules over.
