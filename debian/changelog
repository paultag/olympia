olympia (1.0.4) olympia-unstable; urgency=medium

  * Change the location of the archive to the new S3 location, until
    I set up a CNAME for the archive. At the moment, this is going to
    wind up more stable and secure, since I can process the archive on
    the LAN, and push it to the internet, rather than having an online
    archive key.

olympia (1.0.3) olympia-unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a new package - olympia-markdown, which contains dependencies
    on packages needed to process markdown. Mostly, I compile markdown
    to PDFs, so this is all it depends on at the moment.

olympia (1.0.2) olympia-unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a Depends on olympia-libpam-pkcs11 from olympia-serving-suggestions,
    which means it'll be pulled in by default on standard desktop installs.
  * Add a new metapackage for server installs that doesn't depend on the
    custom PAM work or Desktop stuff.
  * Add a new archive .deb that contains my archive's OpenPGP keyring,
    and sources.list entry. This isn't depended on by anything, and is
    mostly helpful to get a new system set up quicker.

olympia (1.0.1) olympia-unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a new module, olympia-libpam-pkcs11, which depends on libpam-pkcs11,
    and installs some configs that make sense for me (a CA, my CN mappings),
    and the pam-auth template. Run `pklogin_finder` to make sure this all
    works before swapping PAM modules over.

olympia (1.0.0) olympia-unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial packaging.
